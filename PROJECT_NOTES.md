## Installation

The following steps were used to create the UI portion of this project.
1. From the `scheduler-app` folder, enter `npx create-react-app scheduler-ui` - this creates the `scheduler-ui` directory and downloads the required `React` files for the project.
2. From the `scheduler-ui` folder, enter `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled` - this installs `Material UI` and also brings in the `Emotion` package.
